Traditional farming in India faces numerous challenges, including limited monitoring, imprecision, environmental unpredictability, wildlife encroachment, lower yields, reduced profitability, and crop drying/fire risks. To address these challenges, IoT-based smart farming offers a transformative solution by leveraging technology for enhanced monitoring, data collection, and analysis.

## Key Challenges in Traditional Farming

- **Limited Monitoring:** Traditional farming lacks real-time monitoring, making it difficult to respond promptly to changing conditions.
  
- **Imprecision:** Precision farming is essential for optimal crop growth, yet traditional methods often lack the precision required.

- **Environmental Unpredictability:** Climate changes and environmental unpredictability can impact crop yield and quality.

- **Wildlife Encroachment:** Wildlife poses a threat to crops, leading to potential losses for farmers.

- **Lower Yields and Reduced Profitability:** Inefficient farming practices result in lower yields and reduced profitability for farmers.

- **Crop Drying/Fire Risks:** Drying and fire risks are significant concerns in traditional farming, affecting both crop quality and safety.

## IoT-Based Smart Farming Solutions

Smart farming with IoT addresses these challenges by incorporating advanced technologies for improved monitoring and management.

### Components of the System:

1. **Sensors for Real-time Data Collection:**
   - Temperature, Humidity, Air Quality
   - Soil Moisture, Nutrient Levels, pH

2. **Microcontrollers and Cloud Connectivity:**
   - Microcontrollers transmit data to the cloud for real-time analysis and decision-making.

3. **Fire Detection System:**
   - Includes a fire alarm with flame and MQ-135 gas sensors for early detection of fire risks.

4. **Wildlife Deterrence:**
   - Utilizes a laser fence to deter wildlife and prevent crop damage.

5. **Web Technologies for Data Management:**
   - HTML, CSS, JS, Spring Boot, and MySQL are integrated for efficient data management and display.

## Setting up the Smart Farming System

### Prerequisites:

1. **Eclipse and Tomcat:**
   - Install Eclipse IDE for Java EE Developers.
   - Set up Apache Tomcat for deploying the Spring Boot application.

2. **Database Setup:**
   - Use MySQL for data storage.
   - Set up a database and configure Spring Boot to connect to it.

### Steps to Run the Spring Boot Project:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
